#What is audibl?

**audibl** is a high performance music metadata parser written for native Java.

##There are a million metadata parsers out there!  Why should I use yours?

 - audibl is designed to the interface; that is, you should *never* have to instantiate an object to get an MP3.
 - audibl is programmed to be as quick as possible, making use of Java 7's NIO library.
 - audibl is meant to provide an easy way to read and manipulate the metadata of any song file.

##What file types do you support?
The initial release of audibl intends to have support for the following file types:

 - MP3
 - Ogg Vorbis
 - FLAC

Support for other media file types is in the near future.

##I'm interested!  How could I help?

There are a number of ways you can help:

  - Contribute code, either by adding your favorite file format, or fixing bugs.
  - Contribute documentation, through the use of Javadocs.
  - Contribute constructive criticism and bug reports.
  - If this gets big enough, I'll set something up so you could contribute by buying me a beer. :)


##What is the testing framework?

We make use of Mockito and full unit tests.  Before any code can be accepted, unit tests must be written, and existing unit tests must still pass.
